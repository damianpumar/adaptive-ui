Adaptive UI is a revolutionary library that enables developers to create intelligent, context-aware user interfaces that adapt dynamically based on AI-driven insights. Move beyond static components and build interfaces that truly respond to user needs in real-time.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Components** - Components that adapt their behavior and appearance based on context
- ⚡ **Dynamic Rendering** - Real-time UI adjustments without page reloads
- 🎨 **Intelligent Layouts** - Automatically optimized layouts for different user scenarios
- 🔄 **Context-Aware** - Components that understand and respond to user behavior
- 🛠️ **Developer-Friendly** - Simple API with powerful capabilities
- 📱 **Responsive by Design** - Works seamlessly across all devices

## 🎮 Live Demo

Experience Adaptive UI in action at our interactive playground:

Explore different forms, layouts, and see how the UI adapts to various user contexts in real-time.

## 💡 Core Concepts

### Context-Driven Adaptation

Adaptive UI uses context to make intelligent decisions about how components should render:

```typescript
export interface Context {
  sessionId: string;
  /** [MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigator/language) */
  language: string;
  timestamp: number;
  persona: string;
}
```

### AI-Powered Components

Components that learn and adapt based on user interactions:

```typescript
<AIComponent
  intent="Show product card"
  data={data}
/>

<AIText
  intent="Summarize product features"
  data={data}
/>

<AIChart
  intent="Summarize sales by quarter"
  data={data}
/>

<AIVideo
  intent="Show promotional video"
  data={data}
  durationMS={3000}
/>
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **E-commerce** - Product forms that adapt based on user behavior
- **Dashboards** - Layouts that reorganize based on usage patterns
- **Forms** - Dynamic form fields that appear/disappear based on context
- **Onboarding** - Personalized user journeys for different user types
- **Content Platforms** - Adaptive content presentation based on preferences
